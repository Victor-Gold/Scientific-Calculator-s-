# Simple Calculator

Project from the JavaScript Web Projects course - Andrei Neagoie | Udemy.

This simple 🍦 vanilla JS 🍦 calculator implementation helped me understand the logic behind basic Math methods and the use of Arrow Functions.

Throughout this project I practiced:  

- DOM manipulation 
- CSS Grid layout
- Event Listeners
- Arrow Functions
- Math methods logic
- Code structure

I learned a lot about how important the code structure is and since then, I use this knowledge on all of my projects.
